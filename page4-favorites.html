    "It's a game of thinking just like everybody else! All players are asked the same question,
    then write down their responses at the same time. Answer with the majority, join the GREEN TEAM
    and get points. Don't: join the ORANGE TEAM and get nothing.. 1) Get on the GREEN TEAM. 2) Stay
    on the GREEN TEAM. 3) WIN." -From the publisher <br>

    <figcaption>In the Palm of Your Hand</figcaption>
    "In the Palm of Your Hand is a new team-based game from first-time designer Timothée Decroix! Help
    your grandparent relive their memories using 11 different 3D objects and over 100
    beautifully-illustrated cards! One player (grandchild) must “mime” memories depicted on cards by
    using objects in the palm of another player (grandparent), whose eyes are shut. The grandchild draws
    2 random cards from their hand, secretly looks at them, then uses any of the 11 3D objects included in
    the box to mime the memories in the grandparent's palm. Cards are added (by the opposing team and
    from the deck) until there are 8 cards total. The grandparent then opens their eyes and must find
    the 2 correct memories out of the 8 cards on the table! The game ends once everyone has had a chance
    to be the grandparent!" -BoardGameGeek

    "By all appearances, it's just two players taking turns laying stones on a 19×19 (or smaller) grid
    of intersections. But once its basic rules are understood, Go shows its staggering depth. One can
    see why many people say it's one of the most elegant brain-burning abstract games in history, with
    players trying to claim territory by walling off sections of the board and surrounding each other's
    stones. The game doesn't end until the board fills up, or, more often, when both players agree to
    end it, at which time whoever controls the most territory wins." -BoardGameGeek
