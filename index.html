    <h2>The world of board games may be bigger than you think</h2>
        <p>
            When you hear the words "board games", do you think of Monopoly and Scrabble? If a friend invited you
            to play a board game, would your immediate reaction be to sigh and assume you're in for a snooze-fest?
            Well think again! The world of board games is vast and exciting. It's time you learned how much fun
            you've been missing!
        </p>
    <h2>There are board games that you (yes, you) will love</h2>
        <p>
            You may be able to name a dozen or so board games, but did you know that there are <em>tens of thousands</em>?
            Past the more general types such as dice-rolling or card games, there are dozens of genres including
            deck-building, campaign, social deduction, puzzle-solving, abstract, area control, eurogame... (don't worry if
            you don't know what all of those are!). And inside those, hundreds of styles of play. That means that there
            is literally something for everyone, even those who think they don't like board games at all! And we guarantee

            Perhaps the best way to get into board games is to be invited by a knowledgeable friend to play something
            they think you would like. But if you don't have any friends with such a hobby, don't fret! Not only are
            there many resources online to help you get you started, as board games are seeing a rise in popularity, you
