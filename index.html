<h2>The world of board games may be bigger than you think</h2>
    <p>
        When you hear the words "board games", do you think of Monopoly and Scrabble? If a friend invited you
        to play a board game, would your immediate reaction be to sigh and assume you're in for a snooze-fest?
        Well think again! The world of board games is vast and exciting. It's time you learned how much fun
        you've been missing!
    </p>
<h2>There are board games that you (yes, you) will love</h2>
    <p>
        You may be able to name a dozen or so board games, but did you know that there are <em>tens of thousands</em>?
        Past the more general types such as dice-rolling or card games, there are dozens of genres including
        deck-building, campaign, social deduction, puzzle-solving, abstract, area control, eurogame... (don't worry if
        you don't know what all of those are!). And inside those, hundreds of styles of play. That means that there
        is literally something for everyone, even those who think they don't like board games at all! And I guarantee
        that there are board games that you (again, yes <em>you</em>) would LOVE if you tried them.
    </p>
<h2>Try something!</h2>
    <p>
        Perhaps the best way to get into board games is to be invited by a knowledgeable friend to play something
        they think you would like. But if you don't have any friends with such a hobby, don't fret! Not only are
        there many resources online to help you get you started, as board games are seeing a rise in popularity, you
        may even find board game cafes in your area! There you can have a snack, make friends, and most importantly,
        play games! They are a perfect place to get your feet wet, and friendly staff will surely give you
        recommendations to help find what you like. Did I mention you can also play board games online??
