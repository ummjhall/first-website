        "It's a game of thinking just like everybody else! All players are asked the same question,
        then write down their responses at the same time. Answer with the majority, join the GREEN TEAM
        and get points. Don't: join the ORANGE TEAM and get nothing.. 1) Get on the GREEN TEAM. 2) Stay
        on the GREEN TEAM. 3) WIN." -From the publisher<br>

        transparent cards in Imagine, whether they're placed next to one another or superimposed. Almost
        everything in the world can be represented by a simplified concept — just don't speak while

        <figcaption>In the Palm of Your Hand<br><br></figcaption>
        Players in teams of two use any of the 11 included 3D objects to "act out" a scene depicted on a
        card. One player acts out the scene, haptically, in the palm of their teammate's hand while their
        partner has their eyes closed! That player must then choose the correct scene from among other
        red herring cards.<br>

        "By all appearances, it's just two players taking turns laying stones on a 19×19 (or smaller) grid
        of intersections. But once its basic rules are understood, Go shows its staggering depth. One can
        see why many people say it's one of the most elegant brain-burning abstract games in history, with
        players trying to claim territory by walling off sections of the board and surrounding each other's
        stones. ... Whoever controls the most territory wins." -BoardGameGeek<br>
